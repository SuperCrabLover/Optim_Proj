# Application of the stochastic smoothing method for solving problems with a zero-order oracle

## Introduction

Many approaches to solving optimization problems with zeroth-order oracle are constrained by non-smooth object functions. In this work we are focused on smooth problems with only zero-order information accessible. Such tasks are still viable, since sometimes we can not use autograd for obtaining first order information ([art.1](https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.1603.00717)). The approach is based on "stohastic smoothing" ([art.2](https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2201.12289)) using stohastic gradient for gradient approximation. This article provides iteration and zeroth-order oracle call number bounds.
